Adding Comments
=======================
1. Generate Comments resource, specifying the fields as arguments (body:text discussion:references)
2. Check the migration, then run it.
3. Modify the automatically added route to nest under the main projects resource
4. Add action templates for create,edit,update,destroy in Comments controller
5. Check the models. Add has_many comments to discussion relationship, and the dependency relationship. The belongs_to association
should already be established.
6. Modify views to be able to display the comments.
  I realized the display of the discussion needs to change. Project.show must display link to Discussion. Actual discussion should be on its own view page.
7. Modify Discussion controller to display the comment thread, using the discussion#show action
8. Buildup the Comment Controller
9. Setup the Discussion (show)  and Comment (edit) views.

Debug as Required.
